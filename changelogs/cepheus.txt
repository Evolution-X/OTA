===== 22 Jul 2024 =====

NOTES:
- Dirty install is fine from previous official build
- Format Data could be required in other scenarios, check the XDA thread
- OTA Update from the system updater will not work due to a mistake with signing keys. My apollogies. It will be fine for future updates
- If you find that circle-to-search is not working, clear the Google app data, uninstall updates from its app info and update from the Play Store

DEVICE:
- Properly sign the builds. This is the reason for the system updater not to work previously and it will be fine from now on
- Use MINI Gapps

ROM:
- Update Play Integrity Fix app to meet device integrity again
- Fix an issue where notifications with screen on required to disable tje feature and enable it again to work
